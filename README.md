## Overview

Designing and building myself a developer portfolio using React. The portfolio is meant to be visually appealing and easy to navigate through.

Framer Motion is used to add smooth animations and transitions to enhance the user experience. SASS is used as a CSS preprocessor to write modular and maintainable styles. Git is used for version control and to keep track of changes made to the codebase. Vite is used as a development server that allows for fast and efficient development. Figma is used for design and prototyping, and for creating a cohesive visual design for the portfolio.
